            <p>Lata Mangeshkar (28 September 1929 â€“ 6 February 2022) was an Indian playback singer and occasional music composer. She is widely considered to have been one of the greatest and most influential singers in India. Her contribution to the Indian music industry in a career spanning seven decades gained her honorific titles such as the "Nightingale of India" and "Queen of Melody".</p>

            <p>Mangeshkar recorded songs in over thirty-six Indian languages and a few foreign languages, though primarily in Hindi, Bengali, Nepali and Marathi.[15][16] She received several accolades and honors throughout her career. In 1989, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award was bestowed on her by the Government of India.[17] In 2001, in recognition of her contributions to the nation, she was awarded the Bharat Ratna, becoming only the second singer to receive India's highest civilian honour.[18] In 2007, France made her an Officer of the National Order of the Legion of Honour, the country's highest civilian award.[19]
